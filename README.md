# Portfolio Project
### SQL Data Exploration

   In this project, I'll be performing exploratory data analysis and calculations in SQL, which includes using aggregate functions & GROUP BY, JOINS, converting data types using the CAST function, CTEs and other functions used for analysis

  The dataset I will be using is from the website "Our World In Data" where they're focusing on many big problems such as poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality. On this project I'll be focusing on Covid data from February 2020 - February 2022. 
Which can be found through this link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths 

  The data will show many interesting facts, such as a cumulative total of covid cases as the date progresses, and specifying it for each country and continent. I will be splitting the dataset into 2 tables, which includes covid deaths and vaccinations, and my focus will be mainly on covid deaths and vaccinations.

### Python Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
This is a case study to demonstrate my ability in loading the data, cleaning the data, doing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizing the data in Python on a fictional e-commerce business dataset.
